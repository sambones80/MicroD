Install iframe by using the code below EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS!
(script directly above iframe)

<script src="//files.microdinc.com/css/1473/scripts/iframe-sizer.js"></script>
<iframe id="MDFrame" scrolling="no" style="width:100%;border:0;" src="http://www.DOMAIN.com"></iframe>

Under certain circumstances, you may need to add additional CSS (depending on your parent application / code):
<style>
	iframe {
	    width: 1px;
	    min-width: 100%; *width: 100%;
	}
</style>

Since the code from step 1 uses JavaScript to set the iframe height, you shouldn't need to add any "css hacks" such as padding-top, absolute positioning, etc. Doing so can break the responsiveness of our iframe code, we will not provide support if the implementation isn't configured exactly as shown above.

Note:
The scrolling attribute is obsolete in HTML5 but still used in our code as a fallback for older browsers. Technical users may choose to leave this out entirely and use CSS.
